## Top FAQs about PolicyGenius

#### How does PolicyGenius make money?

We’re a licensed insurance broker, so we get paid a commission by insurance companies for each sale. Insurance commissions are already baked into the price of an insurance policy, so you’re not paying any extra for using our service (or any broker’s service for that matter).

We understand that getting a commission on a sale introduces a potential conflict of interest. But we don't push or give preference to any one insurer over another because of the commission. In fact, some health insurance companies don't even pay out commissions. We still show those companies' plans, even though we won't get paid, because we believe in showing consumers all their options in an unbiased manner. For every product, we prioritize what's right for the consumer over maximizing our commissions.

And if you want to know what commission we'd earn on any insurance product you see on this site, just ask us. We’ll be glad to tell you.

#### Shouldn't I just buy directly from the insurer or Healthcare.gov?

You can certainly do that - and for some health insurance companies, you'll actually have to enroll directly with them or on the government site, because they've decided not to allow any licensed brokers like PolicyGenius to sell their plans. However, we can still show all those plans, and help you compare them apples-to-apples with other plans available to you. We've also designed our online experience to be MUCH easier than what you'll find at Healthcare.gov or your state exchange, so you won't gain anything by shopping there (except a headache!)

#### Shouldn't I try more than one comparison site?

You can, but we've designed our site to be the best and easiest shopping experience you'll find anywhere. We've worked hard to offer the widest selection of plans and the most intuitive comparison process for you.

Also, any plan you see on our site won't be any cheaper at another comparison site or government sites. That's because health insurance plan rates are filed with state governments, and everyone is required to show those filed rates.

#### Are the quotes on your site accurate?

Health insurance plan rates are filed with state governments, and everyone is required to show those filed rates. The quotes on our site are pulled directly from these government filings -- so as long as those are accurate, and you've provided accurate information (about age, zip code, income, household size and tobacco status), the quotes you see on our site are accurate.

#### Can I get a cheaper plan somewhere else?

Any plan you see here won't be any cheaper at another site, including government sites. That's because health insurance plan rates are filed with state governments, and everyone is required to show those filed rates.

We've also worked hard to include the widest selection of plans you'll find anywhere. We've got plans you'll find on government sites (Healthcare.gov and the state exchanges) and plans you won't find on those sites (so-called "off-exchange" plans that have all the benefits of "on-exchange" plans but may be cheaper for you).

Yes, we have to include some legalese down here. Read it larger on our legal page. Policygenius Inc. (“PolicyGenius”) is a licensed independent insurance broker. PolicyGenius does not underwrite any insurance policy described on this website. The information provided on this site has been developed by PolicyGenius for general informational and educational purposes. We do our best efforts to ensure that this information is up-to-date and accurate. Any insurance policy premium quotes or ranges displayed are non-binding. The final insurance policy premium for any policy is determined by the underwriting insurance company following application.  Savings are estimated by comparing the highest and lowest price for a shopper in a given health class. For example: for a 30-year old non-smoker male in South Carolina with excellent health and a preferred plus health class, comparing quotes for a $500,000, 20-year term life policy, the price difference between the lowest and highest quotes is 60%. For that same shopper in New York, the price difference is 40%. Rates are subject to change and are valid as of 2/17/17.
