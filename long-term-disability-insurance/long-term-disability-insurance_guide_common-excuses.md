### Common Excuses

## **Most popular excuses for not getting LTD insurance**

If you still have some doubts, explore some of the common excuses below and then **click to see our response.**

_⚄_**The Risk Taker's Excuse**

#### “I have a **low-risk job** so I probably don’t have to worry about disability..."

    

Actually, only 5% of disabilities that keep people out of work for longer periods are work-related. The rest are caused by illnesses or chronic conditions—like arthritis, back pain, and diabetes—that have nothing to do with what type of job you have.

Read More

__**The Spousal Support Excuse**

#### "My**spouse earns a pretty good income** so we’ll be covered if I can’t work..."

    

That could be enough—many two-income households manage just fine on one income for a while, particularly when the working spouse is the primary breadwinner. But consider the fact that the average long-term disability absence lasts 2.5 years and could impose medical expenses beyond what your health insurance would cover. Could your spouse’s income cover your household expenses for that long, even with some belt-tightening? Disability causes nearly 50% of all mortgage foreclosures, so it can be a pretty significant burden.

Read More

__**The Young and Healthy Excuse**

#### "Long-term disability insurance seems like a good idea but**I’m young and healthy**and can just buy it later on..."

    

If LTD insurance seems like a good idea to you, then you should buy it when you’re young and healthy! It’s cheaper now than it will ever be for you because premiums rise as you get older and your risk of disability increases. Buying it now gives you the ability to lock in a lower rate for the life of the policy.

Read More

_💰_**The Cost Excuse**

#### "Long-term disability insurance seems like a good idea but I**just can't afford it**..."

    

If you‘re truly living paycheck to paycheck just to cover basic expenses, then unfortunately disability insurance might be out of your reach.

Otherwise, consider that premiums on average cost 1–3% of your gross income. This may actually be a small price to pay to insure your most important asset—your paycheck. Consider whether it’s really unaffordable for you.

  * For a person earning $60K/year compare the average monthly cost of:
  * **Dining out:**$212
  * **Health insurance:**$182
  * **Phone service:**$114
  * **Car insurance:**$100
  * **Disability insurance:**$100

_⌂_**The Parent's Basement Excuse**

#### "I can **rely on my family or friends** to help me out..."

    

That’s great that you have family or friends who are there for you. We’ve all relied on loved ones at some point. But have you truly considered the impact a potential disability would have on them? The average long-term disability lasts 2.5 years and could impose medical expenses beyond what your health insurance would cover. Could your friends or family care for you for that amount of time without incurring significant hardship?

_🏦_**The Social Safety Net Excuse**

#### “I’m sure there’s some sort of**government safety net**to protect me if I’m truly unable to work and support myself...”

    

Thankfully there are some social safety nets to help protect us—but they’re not as reliable as you might think.**Over 95% of disabling accidents and illnesses are NOT work-related,** meaning Workers’ Compensation doesn’t cover them.

If you’re disabled to the point that you can’t work (or work as much as you could before you fell ill) then you could file for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. To qualify for SSDI, you have to be unable to do any occupation (not just the occupation you had before your disability that you may have specially trained or were educated for) and have been totally disabled for at least 5 months. But did you know that nearly 65% of initial SSDI claims applications are denied? If you successfully appeal the denial, it could take up to 2 years to start receiving benefits. And if approved, the average monthly benefit paid by SSDI is around $1,000 a month. Could you wait that long? Could you make do with that amount?

_🔒_**The False Sense of Security Excuse**

#### “I have disability**insurance through my job,** so I’m covered..."

    

That’s great—about 100 million working Americans have no disability insurance so you’re in a better spot than many people. But you should still double-check to make sure you’re sufficiently covered. For many people with employer-provided LTD insurance, there is still a possible coverage “gap” because the maximum coverage amount is usually around 60% of base salary and those benefits are taxable (effectively lowering the coverage amount anywhere from 20-30% depending on your tax bracket).

Plus, **if you leave your employer, you can’t take your disability coverage with you.**

## **Legitimate excuses**

Not every excuse is a bad one. Here are a few that make total sense to us.

_⏱_**The Savvy Risk Takers Excuse**

#### “I’m only a**few years away from retirement,** so I probably don’t need it at this point...”

    

  * #### _👍_**You’re right**

You’re probably right. If you’re close to retirement, your premium for disability insurance would probably be so high (or you might not even be able to qualify for a policy) that you’re better off saving that cash and making sure you’re self-insured until you retire.

__**The Super Saver Excuse**

#### "I have enough**cash savings and other liquid assets**to last me if I’m unable to work for a long time..."

    

  * #### _👍_**You’re right**

That’s great—you’re certainly in a much better spot than most people. If you have plenty to cover you through the average duration of a long-term disability (approximately 2.5 years), then you probably would be better off adding to your savings than purchasing disability insurance.

However, there is some risk that a work-limiting disability could last beyond 2.5 years—1 in 7 workers can expect to be disabled for five years or more before retirement. Consider whether 1–3% of your annual gross income is worth the added peace of mind.
