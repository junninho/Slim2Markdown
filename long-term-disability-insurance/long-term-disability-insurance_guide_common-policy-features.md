### Policy Features

## **Need-to-know policy features**

PolicyGenius has done the research on disability insurance. We recommend the following features for your policy.

_💵_**Untaxed monthly benefit**

#### Should be approximately **60% of your gross annual income** and should be close to your current take-home pay.

    

  * #### __**Why**

If you purchase LTD insurance on your own, the income benefits are tax-free, so you should apply for an amount equal to your take-home pay or your current monthly budget.

  * #### __**Tip**

You can’t get a policy benefit higher than 80% of your gross income.




Read More

__**Non-cancelable policy**

#### The insurer **can’t cancel the policy or change the terms** (including the premium rate), as long as the premiums are paid.

    

  * #### __**Why**

This puts you in control of your policy and lets you lock in favorable rates today, for as long as you want the policy.

  * #### __**Tip**

Watch out for conditionally renewable policies which offer virtually no guarantee that your policy will be renewed.




Read More

_🔒_**Own occupation policy**

#### Defines a disability as the inability to work at your **regular occupation,** even if you still might be able to work at another occupation.

    

  * #### __**Why**

An**own occupation policy**does not penalize you for going back to work in a different occupation while receiving disability benefits. The alternative form is an any occupation policy which allows the insurance company to deny benefits if you’re able to work in any form of gainful employment for which you’re qualified.

  * #### __**Tip**

Closely read the definition of your occupation in your policy to ensure that it accurately reflects the material duties of your occupation.




Read More

_⏱_**Benefit period to age 67**

#### The most comprehensive disability policy will **cover you until age 67** —meaning if you get permanently disabled from working in your 30s, you’ll be covered until 67 when your retirement benefits take over.

    

  * #### __**Why**

Bankruptcies often arise from extended periods of illness. A policy that will cover you until 67 will protect you even in the most catastrophic situations.

  * #### __**Tip**

Insurers know that, on average, once disabilities go past 90 days, they last between 2-5 years. So for policies with benefit terms longer than 5 years, the incremental premium is lower. If you can afford it, a policy to age 67 is advisable for the peace of mind.

_⏱_**90-day elimination period**

#### We recommend a **90-day elimination period** for your policy. An elimination period is the time between the start of your disability and receiving your first benefit check. Disability policies can carry elimination periods of 30, 60, 90, 180 or 365 days.

    

  * #### __**Why**

The longer your elimination period, the lower your premium. Most policies are designed to be cost-effective with a 90-day waiting period. That means, the discount you get with a longer waiting period may not be worth the extra risk you take on.

  * #### __**Tip**

You should look at your financial situation to determine how long you can be without an income to decide what elimination period is best for you.

_⏱_**Residual disability benefits**

#### A policy with residual disability coverage pays benefits if you **can work some time but not all of the time due** to a disability. The policy will help cover the partial loss of income with a partial payout of your disability benefit.

    

  * #### __**Why**

Partial disabilities are much more common than total disabilities (where you can’t work at all for an extended period of time). The residual disability benefit makes sure you’re covered in all situations where a health condition negatively affects your income.

  * #### __**Tip**

Watch out for some policies for which, to qualify for residual disability coverage, you must first qualify for a period of total disability. This is the least favorable option.

## **Add-ons to consider**

Add-ons (or “riders”) will cost you more but provide benefits that can be a good value for some people. Read on to see some optional add-ons worth considering.

_🔒_**Future increase option**

#### This option lets you **increase your monthly benefit on specified dates** without having to go through the medical exam and underwriting process again. But you will need to provide proof of the higher income you’re insuring.

    

  * #### __**Why**

If you expect your income to rise in the future, you should lock in insurability (and rates) based on your health status now. You don’t want to be in a position where you can’t insure a higher income due to an unforeseen health issue.

_⏱_**Cost of living adjustment (COLA)**

#### It increases the benefit payable on a claim **every year to help fight inflation.**

    

  * #### __**Why**

If you need to claim disability benefits over a long period of time, inflation can quickly erode the value of these benefits.

The final insurance policy premium for any policy is determined by the underwriting insurance company following application.  Savings are estimated by comparing the highest and lowest price for a shopper in a given health class. For example: for a 30-year old non-smoker male in South Carolina with excellent health and a preferred plus health class, comparing quotes for a $500,000, 20-year term life policy, the price difference between the lowest and highest quotes is 60%. For that same shopper in New York, the price difference is 40%. Rates are subject to change and are valid as of 2/17/17.
