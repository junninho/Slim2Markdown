## Top FAQs about PolicyGenius

#### Isn't pet insurance a scam? Why does PolicyGenius sell pet insurance?

At PolicyGenius, we offer only products we believe in, and would buy for ourselves. And that applies to pet insurance. A lot of people think pet insurance is a 'scam' if you don't get back more money than you pay in for it.

That's the wrong way to think about pet insurance (and any insurance for that matter). 

Pet insurance is about having a safety net in the event of major and unpredictable health expenses for your furry best friend. 

Want to know more? We talked to [Vox magazine about pet insurance and why it's not a ripoff](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9123013/dogs-insurance-should-i-buy). 

#### How is PolicyGenius different from other pet insurance insurance sites?

PolicyGenius is the only pet insurance site you'll need. Here you can find: 

  * All the top pet insurance companies and plans so you don't have to shop elsewhere
  * Everything you need to know, explained in plain English, so you don't have to research elsewhere
  * Exclusive discounts that can save you up to 20%



####  How does PolicyGenius make money?

We get paid a commission by the pet insurance company when we help you buy a plan for your pet. But don't worry - these commissions are already priced into the cost of pet insurance - so you're not paying extra to work with us. Plus, we've negotiated exclusive discounts with the pet insurance companies we work with, so we can help save you money too!

#### ​ Shouldn't I buy directly from the pet insurance company?

When you shop and find a plan through PolicyGenius, our site connects you to the pet insurance company site to complete your purchase. And our site offers one big advantage: you can compare plans and prices side-by-side to find the best plan for your best friend!
